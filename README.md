# Hi!
### Łukasz Szoszkiewicz, PhD

I am a social scientist with a legal background and a self-trained data scientist.

My research focuses on <strong>international human rights law</strong> and the challenges posed by new technologies, such as <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> and <strong>neurotechnologies</strong>. Considering how digital technologies erase geographical boundaries, it’s vital to address new challenges from a global perspective. This is why my work concentrates on the UN framework, with a specific focus on social rights and the rights of the child.

I employ a range of methodologies, including natural language processing (Python), statistics, corpus linguistics, and grounded theory.

Currently, I am working on <a href="https://lszoszk.github.io/projects/neurorights/">neurorights</a> and develop a <a href="https://lszoszk.github.io/projects/generalcomments/">search engine for the UN Treaty Bodies' documents</a>.
